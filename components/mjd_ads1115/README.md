# ESP-IDF MJD: TI ADS1115 16-Bit ADC 4 Channel with Oscillator and Programmable Gain Amplifier
This component is for **the TI ADS1115 Analog to Digital Converter**.

This component is designed to be used in combination with the **ESP-IDF** software framework for the ESP32 hardware from Espressif.

The ESP-IDF component configures the I2C slave device and returns **the raw readings and the voltage-adjusted readings** of the analog input pin(s) on the ADS1115.

The ADS1115 is typically used to process up to 4 analog input signals from various devices (e.g. battery voltage, analog sensor, gas sensor, piezo vibration sensor, temperature sensor, etc). It measures the voltage (compared to GND) of an analog pin, or the voltage difference between 2 analog pins.

## Example ESP-IDF project(s)
```esp32_ads1115_adc_using_lib``` This project demonstrates the component mjd_ads1115. It uses a 50% voltage divider setup so you can measure GND (+-0V), VCC (3.3V) and the divided voltage (+-1.65V).

```esp32_tmp36_sensor_ads1115_adc_using_lib``` This project demonstrates the components mjd_tmp36 and mjd_ads1115. The component mjd_tmp36 instructs the component mjd_ads1115 to read the voltage from the Analog TMP36 analog temperature sensor with the proper ADC settings, and converts the voltage to degrees Celsius.

```
PIN#  PIN NAME	  Description
----  ----------  -----------
 1    V VCC       Power supply (3.3V for the ESP32)
 2    G GND       Ground
 3    SCL         I2C Serial Clock (10K pullup on breakout board)
 4    SDA         I2C Serial Data (10K pullup on breakout board)
 5    ADDR        I2C slave address select (10K pulldown on breakout board)
 6    ALERT/READY Comparator output or conversion ready (10K pullup on breakout board)
 7    A0          Analog input 0
 8    A1          Analog input 1
 9    A2          Analog input 2
10    A3          Analog input 3
```

These breakout boards contain:

* A **10K pullup resistor** for the pin(s): I2C SCL, I2C SDA, **ALERT/READY**.
* A **10K pulldown resistor** for the pin(s): **ADDR**.
* A **ceramic 100nF bypass capacitor** between VCC and GND.
* **A ferrite bead** for the VCC and GND traces.

These breakout boards expose **4 analog input pins**. You will only wire up the ones you need in your project; leave the others one floating.

**The ALERT/READY pin** asserts low at the end of a conversion (active low), and this functionality must be activated manually.



### Wiring for the I2C protocol

- Connect device pin "V" to the MCU pin VCC (3.3V).
- Connect device pin "G" to the MCU pin GND.
- Connect device pin "SCL" to the MCU pin SCL. I use GPIO#21 on the HUZZAH32 dev board.
- Connect device pin "SDA" to the MCU pin SDA. I use GPIO#17 on the HUZZAH32 dev board.
- Connect device pin "ALERT/READY" to an MCU input pin. I use GPIO#16 on the HUZZAH32 dev board. The use of this pin is optional but using it results in faster response times when reading ADC values.



### Wiring up the ADS1115 analog input pins

[TODO Check if a RC Low Pass Filter is relevant for this app. <https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/practical-filter-design-precision-adcs.html> ]

- Using **a 2 meter copper wire (22 AWG)** to hookup a slave device to an ADS115 analog pin did not affect the voltage readings.
- For wires longer than 2 meter you might have to add a 750 Ohm resistor in series with the input pin to reduce the noise.
- For extreme long length it is advised to convert the voltage output of the client device to a current output (4-20mA current loop).



## The I2C protocol

### General

- The device acts as a slave.
- The IC supports various I2C clock speeds: Standard Mode (100 KHz), Fast Mode (400 KHz), Fast Mode Plus (1 Mhz), High Speed: 3.2 Mbit/s. @important **The maximum I2C speed of the ESP32 is 1 MHz.** @tip **Very slow speeds such as 10Khz when using long data wires (>25cm) is also supported.**

### Device I2C Slave Address

**Default I2C Address: 0x48.**

@tip Use the project ```esp32_i2c_scanner``` to detect the actual I2C Address.

- The I2C Address can be modified. Read the instructions in the data sheet section "9.5.1.1 I2C Address Selection". You also have to specify a different I2C Address when configuring the mjd_ads1115 component using the "i2c_slave_addr" property.

### I2C Pullup Pulldown Resistors

**The breakout boards mentioned above contain a 10K pullup resistor for the following pins: I2C SCL, I2C SDA, ALR.**

Therefore it is not needed to wire external 10K pullup resistors from the device pins I2C SCL and I2C SDA to the MCU pin VCC (3V), or to enable the MCU's internal pullups for these device pins.

If you want to use multiple ADS1115 breakout boards in your project then the **total pullup value** of each I2C pin (SCL, SDA) will become too high and the transition times on the I2C bus lines will become unacceptable. A total pullup value (per I2C pin) of +32K is considered too high, depending on the length of the wires and the I2C bus speed (typically Standard Mode 100 Khz). It is also possible that other non-ADS1115 breakout boards, or the main PCB,  contain pullup resistors. **The solution** is either to lower the I2C bus speed to e.g. 10Khz (that is configurable in the component) or to de-solder some pulldown resistors until the total pullup value of each I2C pin is within the boundaries for that configuration.

### Wire length and the I2C pins SCL and SDA

- It is important to have stable I2C connections for a breadboard setup: use **good quality breadboards** (many have bad contacts, especially ones that have been used for a while), use **short good quality Dupont cables***. In my experience a stock Dupont cable of 30cm is too long when using these modules on a breadboard (for the SCL and SDA connections). A 5cm Dupont cable always works.
- It is better to solder everything on a PCB as soon as possible, to use quality wires and the best connectors.

## FAQ: Is an ADS1115 better than the TI CD74HC4051 8-Channel Analog Multiplexer Demultiplexer?

It are totally differences IC's.

The ADS1115 can only read analog voltages from client devices (unidirectional) whilst the CD74HC4051 supports bidirectional communication. The CD74HC4051 can be used to multiplex whatever protocol (such as I2C); it is not limited to just reading analog voltages.

The ADS1115 contains an accurate 16-bit ADC with oscillator and Gain Amplifier. Using the CD74HC4051 means that you will use the ADC that comes with the microcontroller (these are typically not very accurate).

The ADS1115 supports up to 4 input channels. The CD74HC4051 supports up to 8 input/output channels.




## IC/Module/ESP-IDF Component FAQ
- Why is an external ADC module essential in combination with an ESP32?
  The ADC readings of the ESP32 module's ADC are not linear, the accuracy is only 12-bit, contains 2 ADC's but one is actually allocated to the WiFi functionality.
  The ADS1115 is much better: does not lose linearity within the whole input range, officially 16-bit (actually 15-bit for positive voltages), a maximum of 4 input signals, includes a Programmable Gain Amplifier, supports differential conversions, incorporate a low-drift voltage reference, ...
- Operating voltage 2V - 5.5V.
- The market offers several breakout modules which are very handy. The ADS1115 IC is very small (X2QFN 10 pins 1.50 mm × 2.00 mm, VSSOP 10 pins 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm) and so can be hard to solder manually if you want to make your own breakout board.
- Check **the data sheet ** for detailed information.
- Check **the example projects** for practical information.
- Check **the documented sources of this component** for detailed information.
- The IC can only process **analog input voltages in the range of GND–0.3 V ... VCC + 0.3 V**. Note that VCC is 3.3V for an ESP32. Else you might fry the device.
- The **sampling frequency** is 250 kHz.
- The component implements the full range of up to 4 **Single Ended Input Signals**  or up to 2 **Differential Input Signals**. The input multiplexer is used to declare which one, and what type of, input signal you want to process (these settings can be changed in software). The **default Input Multiplexer in the component** is set to "0_GND" and this means one single-ended input signal on pin A0 which is compared to GND. You can change this when configuring the component. Check out the functions ```mjd_ads1115_init()``` and ```mjd_ads1115_set_mux()```.
- The device can read bipolar differential signals but it **cannot process negative voltages on either input signal**.
- The **default Programmable Gain Amplifier** in the component is set to 4.096V and this covers the max voltage of 3.3V (see earlier). You can change this when configuring the component. Check out the functions ```mjd_ads1115_init()``` and ```mjd_ads1115_set_pga()```.
- The **default Output Data Rate** in the component is set to 8 Samples Per Second (#samples per second range 8 .. 860). You can change this when configuring the component. Check out the functions ```mjd_ads1115_init()``` and ```mjd_ads1115_set_data_rate()```. The **conversion time** is related to the samples per second setting (1/X).  The **amount of signal noise** is relative to the Output Data Rate setting.
- The use of **the ALERT/READY pin** is optional. If it is enabled and wired up then that pin is monitored to determine that a measurement is ready to be read. If it is not enabled then the component uses a calculated delay (based on Data Rate Samples Per Second) before reading the measurement. It is more efficient to use that pin.
- The component implements **Single Measurement Mode ** (not Continuous Measurement Mode). Note that you can also read conversions at relatively high speed using SMM for sensor projects.
- The component can be used to **read/write all documented properties in the device** registers. Check the source ```mjd_ads1115_defs.h``` for more information.
- The features **Continuous Conversion Mode** and **Threshold Alerting** are not implemented in this component because that typically requires a tight integration with the main program; so not good candidates for a generic component.
- The ADS1115 can output slightly negative values in case the analog input is close to 0 V (GND) due to device offset. This situation is handled in software.
