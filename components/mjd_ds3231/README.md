# ESP32 MJD DS3231 Real Time Clock component
This is component based on ESP-IDF for the ESP32 hardware from Espressif.

The board is based on the DS3231 chip which are typically used as an RTC Real Time Clock.

Some boards can also be used as an accurate external 32KHz crystal oscillator for the ESP32.



## Example ESP-IDF project

## Supported Products.
1. The blue circular ChronoDot V2 PCB Real Time Clock Module.
2. The blue rectangular large ZS042 DS3231 RTC Real Time Clock Module.
3. The black smaller model (with yellow capacitor) for Raspberry Pi RTC Real Time Clock Module.

## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
