# ESP-IDF MJD DHT11 meteo sensor component
This is component based on ESP-IDF for the ESP32 hardware from Espressif.



## Example ESP-IDF project
my_dht11_temperature_sensor_using_lib

## Shop Product
KY-015 DHT11 Temperature Humidity Sensor Module For Arduino.



## Wiring Instructions
### MCU
a. Adafruit HUZZAH32
- Pin #13 = Blue LED on the PCB
- Pin #14 = sensor data pin (Huzzah32 GPIO#14: bottomright -2)

b. Wemos Lolin32 Lite
- Pin #22 = Blue LED on the PCB
- Pin #19 = sensor data pin (Lolin32lite GPIO#13: topright +2)

### Sensor PIN layout
```
1 VCC
2 OUT
3 GND
```

### Sensor for the custom 1-WIRE protocol
- Connect pin 1 VCC of the sensor to the MCU pin VCC 3V.
- Connect pin 2 OUT of the sensor to the MCU pin DATA (whatever pin you selected above).
- Connect pin 3 GND of the sensor to the MCU pin GND.
- Connect a 5K PULL-UP resistor from the sensor pin 2 OUT to the MCU pin VCC 3.3V  \
  @important You will often get checksum errors without this pullup resistor.
- OPTIONAL: connect a 100nF capacitor between pin 1 VCC and pin 3 GND of each sensor for power filtering. \

## Sensor FAQ
- OK 3.3V
- Metrics: temperature, humidity.
- Uses a custom 1-Wire protocol.
- The startup time of the sensor after power-on is 1 second.
- Recommended minimum reading time interval: 1x / minute.



## Issues
- **Only supports temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius.**
- Burden: external pull-up resistors are always required.
- Burden: does not support the I2C protocol (but the timing sensitive 1-Wire protocol).



## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
