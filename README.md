# MJD ESP32 components for ESP-IDF

This project contains a ton of **components for the ESP32 ESP-IDF framework** which targets the ESP32 chip of Espressif.

The project can be **executed on its own** and it will use all the components that do not require additional hardware or wiring; for example it will demonstrate all features of the "mjd" component but it will not demonstrate the "mjd_bme280" because it requires that a Bosch BME280 meteo sensor is wired to the microcontroller.

## Instructions

Go to the README of the ESP32 Starter Kit for more information.

## Running the example
- Run `make flash monitor` to build and upload the example to your board and connect to its serial terminal.



## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
